<p>2.1. Establishment of the Ryazan Province</p>
<p>On February 28, 1778, the Ryazan Province was established by the decree of Catherine II. Its creation was entrusted to the Russian military and statesman Mikhail Nikitich Krechetnikov (1729-1793).</p>
<p>Pereyaslavl Ryazan was renamed Ryazan during the administrative reform. The city received a coat of arms depicting a warrior with a sword, or "prince", an ancient heraldic symbol of the Ryazan lands.</p>
<p>In 1780, for the first time in the history of the city, a plan for regular development was developed. It provided for a significant expansion of the borders of the provincial capital and the emergence of new quarters built up with public and private buildings. To help the townspeople, standard samples were offered – "model facades" of houses. All of them were designed in the style of the then fashionable classicism.</p>
<p>The new layout has led to the relocation of the main centers of urban life. The historical center of the city – the Kremlin – turned out to be located on the north-eastern outskirts.</p>
<p>According to the new plan, Ryazan occupied an area of 5.5 km2. There were over 50 streets and alleys in the city, one administrative and several retail areas. Three suburban settlements, Troitskaya (later Novo-Alexandrovskaya), Yamskaya and Rybatskaya, adjoined Ryazan from the west, south and east, respectively. The territory of the city was divided into Moscow and Astrakhan parts, the border ran along the riverbed of the Lybedi River.</p>
<p>2.2. Population</p>
<p>Ryazan was a merchant-bourgeois city. In the second half of the XVIII century. the majority of the population – 60% – were merchants, burghers and artisans. About 20% of the population of Ryazan accounted for representatives of the peasant class who lived in the city. Nobles, officials and clergy made up about 20% of the inhabitants of the provincial city.</p>
<p>In 1837, the population in Ryazan was about 10,000 inhabitants, in 1857 – about 22 thousand, in 1897 – over 46 thousand (including suburban settlements).</p>
<p>At the end of the XIX century, 18% of hereditary, personal, honorary citizens and persons of spiritual rank lived in the city, 1.9% were representatives of the merchant class. Burghers made up 24.6% of the city's population. They were engaged in small-scale trade, fishing, handicrafts. The military class was 25.1%. The 137th Nezhensky, 138th Bolkhovsky regiments and the 35th Artillery Brigade were quartered in the city. A large proportion of the population of Ryazan accounted for peasants 30.4%.</p>
<p>2.3 Economy of the provincial city</p>
<p>The establishment of the province, the raising of the status of Ryazan contributed to the economic growth of the city. Trade and handicraft remained the main occupations of most residents, production was developed to a lesser extent.</p>
<p>By 1800, there were 223 shops and 21 drinking houses in Ryazan, about 10 small factories, mainly salting, tanning and candle factories. The only relatively large industrial enterprise of the city was the linen production of merchants Ipatiev.</p>
<p>In 1863, a city public bank was opened in Ryazan at the expense of merchant and philanthropist Sergei Afanasyevich Zhivago (1794-1866). Over time, it will become one of the largest urban banks in Russia and will become famous for its large-scale and purposeful charitable activities.</p>
<p>In 1864 , a railway was built between Moscow and Ryazan with a length of 206 km . In 1866, it was continued from Ryazan in the southern direction to Kozlov (now Michurinsk in the Tambov region). At the end of the XIX – beginning of the XX century. new branches to Vladimir and Kazan appeared, Ryazan turned into a major railway junction. There were two railway stations in the city, both were located in the suburban Novo-Alexandrovskaya Sloboda.</p>
<p>In the second half of the XIX – early XX century. in the provincial city there were about 560 commercial establishments and about 60 industrial enterprises, mostly small. The larger industry was represented by a machine-building plant, two factories of agricultural implements, two dyeing plants, a bed factory, two candle factories, distilleries and breweries each. Ryazan ranked first in European Russia in terms of agricultural machinery production.</p>
<p>During this period, urban improvement received a noticeable development. In 1913, the first power plant was opened in the city, and a water supply system appeared.</p>
<p>2.4. Education and culture</p>
<p>In 1787, a theater was opened in Ryazan – one of the first in provincial Russia. Since 1860, it has been housed in a building on Cathedral Square, now it is the Theater of the Young Spectator. There were meetings in the city – Noble, All-Noble, Officer's, where balls, masquerades, charity evenings were held, films were shown there, visiting celebrities performed. There was a public library, the official Ryazan Provincial Gazette and private city newspapers were published.</p>

<p>Architecture</p>
<p>The period of the late XVIII – XIX century was the heyday of secular stone construction in the city. It was conducted under the leadership of provincial architects Ivan Grigoryevich Sulakadzev, Nikifor Petrovich Milyunov, Nikolai Ilyich Voronikhin, Sergei Alexandrovich Shchetkin and city architect Ivan Stepanovich Tsekhansky.</p>
<p>Classicism became the dominant style of Ryazan architecture. According to the projects of I.G. Sulakadzev, the first two stone public buildings were erected in Ryazan – the Redoubt House (1785) and the provincial Offices (1786). A Cathedral bell tower was erected on the territory of the Ryazan Kremlin (architects I.F. Russian, A.A. Ton, N.I. Voronikhin).</p>
<p>City estates of wealthy residents, nobles and merchants with one- and two-story stone houses surrounded by outbuildings were built on the main streets. They occupied vast territories, many had gardens. The houses of most of the townspeople remained wooden, in the traditions of the Old Russian dwelling.</p>
<p>Ryazan, like other Russian cities, often suffered from fires. The largest occurred in 1837, it destroyed most of the wooden buildings of the central part of the city.</p>
<p>The most significant buildings in the provincial city were the Theological Seminary, the Theological College, the Provincial Hospital, the Noble Assembly, the First Men's Gymnasium, Living Rooms and Bread Rows, the Theater, the Provincial Zemstvo Council.</p>
<p>The largest private building was the palace of Gavrila Vasilyevich Ryumin, a state councilor, a philanthropist who became rich on wine purchases.</p>
